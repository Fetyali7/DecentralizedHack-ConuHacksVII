# DecentralizedHack-ConuHacksVII

This repository contains the code for a blockchain project that utilizes the Hedera network and is hosted on Wix.com. The project is designed to provide an innovative way to transfer electronic documents with a large amount of data using blockchain technology on a decentralized network.

# Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, you will need to have the following installed:

Node.js
A Hedera wallet and account
Once you have these set up, clone this repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

# Sender Component
The sender component of the project is responsible for creating and encrypting the document before adding it to the blockchain. The document format should be JSON or XML and have a minimum size of 1 Megabyte. The sender should also sign the document with their name.

# Receiver Component
The receiver component of the project is responsible for decrypting the received document. The encryption key should be available for the receiver to decode the document.

# Using the Hedera Network
To interact with the Hedera network, you will need to have an account and a wallet set up. You can create one on the Hedera Portal. Once you have your account and wallet, you can use the Hedera JavaScript SDK to interact with the network.

# Hosting on Wix
To host your project on Wix, you will need to have a Wix account and a website set up. You can create a new website on Wix and use the Wix Code feature to add custom code to your website.

Once you have your website set up, you can use the Wix Code API to interact with your website and add your blockchain project to it.
